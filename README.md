# bucharestjs
Demo app based on /r/thebutton and heavily inspired by [primigenus/thebutton](https://github.com/primigenus/thebutton) for BucharestJS June 2015, React Components version

To get started:

* clone this repo
* install [Meteor](https://meteor.com)
* run `meteor`
* visit http://localhost:3000

Rules:
- countdown timer from 30 to 0
- each logged-in user can only click the button *once*
- clicking the button resets the timer for everyone (reactive & real-time)
- users are ranked by click time closest to 0
